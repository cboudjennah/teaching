The roadmap describes how we plan on realizing this project.  Eventually, the roadmap should be managed via gitHub Milestones.  We'll do this, as it matures.

Open Questions are now in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/jastram/teaching/labels/question)

## High-level tasks:

* Decide on [Case Study](https://wiki.eclipse.org/RMF/Teaching#Case_Study)
* Create an Outline of the Training, based on ISO 29110
* Production is broken down into:
  * Teaching Text (currently in the Repository as Latex)
  * Toolchain to be employed
  * Creation of artifacts
