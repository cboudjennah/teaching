* Present were Andrea Herrmann, Dusko Jovanovic, Eckhard Jokisch and Michael Jastram.
* We refined the Vision
* We discussed choosing the case study:
* The case study shall combine software and hardware
* The choice was narrowed down to Coffee Maker, Isolette or Rover 

Next Steps:

* Dusko will update the table
* Each participant will evaluate the various case studies
* We'll eventually decide on a case study using a Doodle Poll
* The decision shall be made within 1-2 weeks.
