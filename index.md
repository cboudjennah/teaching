# Eclipse for Teaching Requirements and Systems Engineering

Requirements Management and Engineering (RE&M) is taught, both in industry and academia. The availability of open source RE-tools, and the RMF-based fmStudio in particular, created some interest for using those tools for teaching.

## Vision

Create (1) a set of teaching materials that is actively used; (2) which is embedded in a larger SE context; and (3) which explicitly focuses on applying RE.

## Scope

The scope is the creation of teaching materials, centered around a case study, based on existing methods and tools. This is visualized in the following picture:
