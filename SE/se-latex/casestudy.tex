We have not decided on a case study yet.  Candidates so far are:

\begin{description}
\item[Coffee Maker.] A long-time favorite, and there are at least three available
\item[FAA Isolette.] This is a complete example from a safety-critical domain. 
\item[Rover.] This one is driven by GaÃ«l Blondelle from the Eclipse Foundation. On the plus side, it's great for the classroom, as the hardware is cheap. But in contrast to the others, there is nothing there yet. 
\end{description}
