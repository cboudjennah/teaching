========

This project records the results from a [discussion on requirements engineering and systems engineering that has started on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/groupItem?commentID=-1&item=5890782095432781827&type=member&gid=128312&view=).  For now, this is mainly text.  We use Latex, as it supports collaboration and scales.

For the time being, we check in the generated PDF.  Later, we can set up a build server to regenerate the PDF:  [Main Document](SE/se-latex/main.pdf)

**We have not decided on a license yet.**  Please wait until this is decided, before contributing.

Thank you for your interest.
